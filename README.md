# NetC
NetC is a programming language designed to be similar to C/C++ but with the power of JS.\n
For exaples there are types for the variables (int, float, bool, ect.)\n
This language contains some unavailabe types on vanilla JS as Matrix, vector, ect...\n


# The tecnology behind that
NetC is "compiled" to a .js source file and run with node.\n
For the lexer I used moo (an npm library) and for the grammar i used nearley.js.\n
This language can be used for front head developing because it doesn't need a main function.\n
